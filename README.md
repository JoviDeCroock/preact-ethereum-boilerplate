## Scripts

- `yarn dev`
  - Spins up the dev server on http://localhost:3000
  - Spins up a local blockchain for testing purposes (creates 20 test accounts)
- `yarn compile:contracts` will compile the contracts in `contracts` with `hardhat`
- `yarn deploy:contracts` deploys the compiled contracts to the local blockchain

## Workflow

We start out by running `yarn dev` which spins up the local servers, followed by compiling and deploying our contracts.
After deploying the contracts we'll see something like `Greeter deployed to: someAddress`, this address is important as it is
the location of where our contract has been deployed.

Next we'll take one of the accounts outputted by `yarn dev` example:

```sh
[1] Account #0: someAddress (10000 ETH)
[1] Private Key: someKey
```

which we'll use in [metamask](https://metamask.io/) to connect to our local blockchain as a generated account. We click
our metamask extension and should see a dropdown in the top-right containing `localhost:8545` this is our locally deployed chain.
Click the Avatar next to the dropdown and proceed to "import account", paste one of the private keys in there and ðŸŽ‰ you're rich... on your own chain...
